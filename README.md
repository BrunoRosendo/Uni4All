# NIterature

## Vision Stament
For members of the University of Porto who would like to seamlessly interact with the library services,
NIterature is an Utility App that provides an easy way to manage UP's library services, such as books reservations.
Unlike the library's online catalog, our product provides an user friendly interface, through a convenient mobile application.

## Main Features
 - Reserve books - Allow UP members to reserve books in UP's library.
 - Management and renewal of books reservation - Allow UP members to renew the previously reserved books and check return dates.
 - Search and filter the library's book collection.

## Assumptions and dependencies
- Library booking api from UPDigital.
- Federated Authentication (UP)
